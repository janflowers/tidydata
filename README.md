# Overview
The code in this repository serves as an example for collecting and manipulating large data into a tidy data set for further analysis.

# Details
Checks for required libraries and installs them if not found.  Then downloades the data sets, unzips them, and performs the following manipulations:

1.  Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
2.  Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 
3.  Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
4.  Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names. 
5.  From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with 
    the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
